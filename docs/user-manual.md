## Component linking and inheritance

### What it is

A clay **phase** is built from one or more **components** — the individual clay
layers it is made of. In many projects the *same* layer appears in more than one
phase. A classic example: an illite layer exists both as a discrete **Illite**
phase and inside an **illite–smectite** mixed-layer phase; a smectite layer
appears in its air-dried, glycolated and heated forms.

Rather than re-entering that layer's structure in every phase, MudLab2 lets one
component **link** to another and **inherit** part of its definition. The linked
component is the *template*; the one that links to it reads the chosen
properties straight from the template. Change the template once and every
component that inherits from it updates automatically.

Inheritance is **per-property**. A glycolated smectite can inherit its cell
dimensions and layer atoms from its 2-water template while keeping its *own*
basal spacing (d001) — which is exactly what makes it a different swelling
state.

### Where to find it

1. Open **Edit → Edit Phases** (or the Phases toolbar button).
2. Select a phase in the list on the left.
3. Open the **Components** tab.
4. Pick a component in the **Component** drop-down at the top.

The **Component linking** group sits below the component's properties. It has:

- a **Linked with** drop-down, and
- a row of **inherit** check-boxes (Cell a, Cell b, Cell c / default c, Δc,
  Layer atoms, Interlayer atoms, and two read-only ones — see *Notes*).

### Linking a component to a template

1. In **Linked with**, choose the template component. The list shows every
   component in the project as `Phase name / Component name`.
2. The inherit check-boxes become enabled. Nothing is inherited yet — linking on
   its own does not change any values.

### Choosing what to inherit

Tick the check-box for each property you want this component to take from its
template:

- **Ticking a box** greys out that field and shows the template's value there.
  The pattern recalculates immediately.
- **Un-ticking a box** hands the field back to this component and restores its
  own value.

For example, tick **Cell a**, **Cell b** and **Layer atoms** on a glycolated
smectite to share the silicate layer with its 2-water template, but leave
**Cell c / default c** un-ticked so it keeps its own expanded spacing.

### Changing an inherited value

An inherited field is greyed on the linked component — you cannot edit it there,
because it belongs to the template. To change it, select the **template**
component (the one shown with *(not linked)*) and edit it. Every component that
inherits that property updates at once.

### Unlinking

Choose **(not linked)** in the **Linked with** drop-down. The link is removed,
all inherit boxes for that component are cleared, and every field returns to
this component's own values.

### Notes and tips

- **Inherited cell a / b also lock the cell-length editor.** When Cell a or
  Cell b is inherited, that cell's fixed/derived editor is disabled — the value
  comes from the template.
- **Two check-boxes are read-only:** *d001 (follows cell c)* mirrors the
  Cell c / default c setting, and *Atom relations* becomes active once the
  atom-relations editor is available.
- **A component cannot link to itself**, and links cannot form a loop
  (A → B → A). Such a choice is refused and the drop-down snaps back.
- **You can link any two components.** MudLab2 does not restrict templates to a
  particular parent phase, so take care to link layers that really are the same
  clay layer.
